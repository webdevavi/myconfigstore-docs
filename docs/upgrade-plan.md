# Upgrade Plan

You can try almost every feature with the free plan, but it will be valid for only 14 days in the trial plan.

For using [myconfig.store](https://www.myconfig.store) in production, you should upgrade to any of the paid plans, though **DEV** plan is recommended.

Let's learn how to upgrade to a paid plan.

> **Important:** Please read and make sure you fully understand our [refund](https://www.myconfig.store/refund) and [cancellation](https://www.myconfig.store/refund#Cancellation%20Policy) policy before making any payments.

## Billing

To upgrade to a paid plan, go to the [billing](https://www.myconfig.store/user/billing) page.
